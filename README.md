# G11_SuperHexagon
FPGA Version of Super Hexagon Game

Note: This project requires a Digilent Nexys 4 DDR development board and a PMOD 2-Axis Joystick to run.

To run this project:
1. Clone the Git repository (using “git clone”) and pull all contents.
2. Make sure Vivado 2016.2 (or higher) and SDK are properly installed on your computer, with support for Artix 7 FPGA. Only Windows platform was tested, though Linux platform should also work.
3. Open super_hexagon.xpr under src/superhexagon/.
4. Generate block design. If block design verification gives critical warnings about mismatches on block ram connection mode, ignore them. This is due to setting block ram in “standalone” mode (in order to use coe files for initialization) while connecting through AXI controller. This is not a real error.
5. Generate bitstream file. Vivado should prompt to run synthesis and implementation because they haven’t been run, click “Yes”.
6. File → Export → Export Hardware.
7. File → Launch SDK. Vivado SDK should launch.
8. Create a new application project: File → New → Application Project. Replace the main C file with the provided C file under /src/software/superhexagon.c. You may need to rename it to the recognized file name (e.g. helloworld.c or memorytest.c) by the SDK or add it to the source file tree of the application project.
9. Make sure the Nexys 4 DDR board is connect to your computer, then programe the FPGA: Xilinx Tools → Program FPGA → click “Program”.
10. Compile project: Project → Build Project (or select “Build Automatically” and just save the C file. This will automatically build your project every time you save).
11. Run project: Run → Run (or ctrl + F11).
